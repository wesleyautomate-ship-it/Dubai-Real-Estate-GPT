# Dubai Real Estate Database Deep Dive
Last updated: 2025-11-24T15:29:41.415778Z
This document describes how the Dubai Real Estate intelligence application stores, relates, and activates its data. It concentrates on the database structure and how each part of the schema fuels concrete product use cases across ingestion, analytics, semantic search, lead tracking, and chat-driven workflows. The content is intentionally long-form so that every team (engineering, data, product, sales) can point to a single source of truth when reasoning about the platform.
## Guiding Principles
- Normalize every property, owner, transaction, and conversation into explicit tables with referential integrity.
- Keep geospatial, vector, and text search capabilities close to the data to power fast filtering, proximity search, and semantic retrieval.
- Preserve lineage and confidence so downstream chat answers can cite their sources and qualify uncertainty.
- Prefer additive migrations (new tables, views, RPCs) over destructive changes to keep ingestion resilient.
- Build helper views and RPC functions that encapsulate complex joins, letting the backend and chat tools stay thin.
## Schema Layers At A Glance
- **Reference & Geography**: communities, districts, projects, clusters, buildings, building_aliases.
- **Core Facts**: properties, transactions, property_events.
- **Parties & Relationships**: owners, owner_contacts, property_owners.
- **Prospecting & Engagement**: leads, lead_actions.
- **Conversations & Chat**: conversations, conversation_messages.
- **Retrieval & Vectors**: chunks, rag_documents, rag_prompt_templates, rag_conversations.
- **Quality & Observability**: data_quality_flags plus indexing strategy and helper views (v_multi_property_owners, v_hot_leads, v_property_hold_duration).
## Entity Descriptions
This section walks through every table defined in `database/schema/neon_blueprint.sql` and the lighter Supabase baseline in `database/schema/supabase_schema.sql`. For each entity we note purpose, key columns, and relationships that matter for joins and tools.
### agents
Purpose: tracks internal users/agents who verify data, own leads, or author chat responses. Stored as UUIDs for cross-system linking.
Key columns: id (uuid PK), user_email, full_name, metadata, created_at.
Relationships: referenced by verification columns across geography, properties, transactions, events, and leads so provenance is auditable.

### views & helpers
- v_multi_property_owners: aggregates portfolio size/footprint per owner via property_owners.
- v_hot_leads: surfaces qualified/hot leads with last_action_at for prioritization.
- v_property_hold_duration (baseline schema): computes hold_years and entry price per sqft.
These views fuel dashboards and chat narratives without recomputing joins in code.
## Ingestion Flow and Persistence
- `database/scripts/ingest_dubai_real_estate.py` normalizes Excel/CSV sources, resolves aliases against buildings/communities, upserts owners, properties, and transactions, and prints metrics.
- Optional AI enrichment (`ai_enrichment.py`) calls Gemini to classify communities/projects/buildings and propose aliases; results populate metadata and alias tables.
- Bulk upserts respect unique constraints (building + unit_identifier, alias uniqueness) to avoid duplicates while preserving history in transactions and property_events.
- After ingestion, embeddings can be generated via `backend/scripts/generate_embeddings.py` or `populate_property_embeddings.py`, filling `properties.description_embedding`, `chunks.embedding`, and `rag_documents.embedding`.
- RPCs and functions (see `database/functions/*.sql`) are applied via `database/scripts/apply_rpc_functions.py` to expose search endpoints to Supabase/pg.
